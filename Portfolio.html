            <h3><strong>Rubinov Lab (2024-Present)</strong></h3>
            <p>I am currently an undergraduate at the Rubinov Lab at Vanderbilt, where I am currently working on projects
               relating to ​​integrative models of large-scale neural data. Right now, I am tasked with converting certain tools requiring 
               parallelism from Spark to Dask.

            <h3>HIVE (2022-Present)</h3>
            <p>Hive is a project that I began developing senior year of high school. The purpose of hive is to build a sensor suite in the form
                of a base for bee hives. The purpose of the sensors is to monitor factors vital to bee health, which has become a prevailing issue
                due to climate change. The vision is to place these hives in remote areas, connect all of them together and get overall
                trends in bee health around the country.

                    <h3>NASA Planetary Environments Laboratory (2022-2023)</h3>
                    <p>I worked with the NASA Planetary Environments Laboratory to write code that would process raw data 
                        from the Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) that analysed soil samples from Mars. I also worked on 
                        artificial data generation to test certain equipment.

                    <p> I was a visitng student at the Brain Aging and Dementia Lab at Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts 
                        General Hospital. I attended weekly lab meetings, shadowed researchers and was given reading assignments to 
                        learn more about the issues the lab was working on.

                    <p> I was a student researcher at the Gottlieb Lab located at Columbia University, where I was mentored by two Ph.D. students and helped out with ongoing
                        Neuroscience research, specifically in the field of attention and decision-making. I specifically worked on creating an experimental model with python based
                        on the research done by one of the Ph.D. students.</p>
