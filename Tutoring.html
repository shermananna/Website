            <h3><span class="bold">So Patient and Knowledgeable!</span></h3>
            <p>My daughter has had 2 sessions with her and has learned so much!!! Anna is patient, knowledgeable and 
                makes things easy to understand for someone who didn't like math in the first place. I even heard my daughter 
                say "Oh that's so cool, I love brackets!" I never thought I'd ever hear her say anything positive about math, 
                but she does now because of Anna. Thank you so much, Anna! <i>- Linda O.</i></p>
